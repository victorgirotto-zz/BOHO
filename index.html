                    <q>My name is Bruce Johnson. I am a 46-year-old Navy veteran who has been homeless in Boulder for 16 years. You know you are homeless when you are walking down the street, come to an intersection, and it does not matter which way you go. I was there for a long time. Then, about two years ago, I became a guest of BOHO Residents Program. After that my whole outlook changed, and then my whole life. Now I have gotten my identification back, I have a job (working for BOHO), a bank account and Iâ€™m saving to get a home. Most importantly I have stability in my life again. I have a direction in my life again and that is in large part because of the stability BOHO has given me. Thank you.</q>
